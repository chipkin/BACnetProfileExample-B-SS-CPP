# Changelog — `common/` (the vendored shared helper)

This is the changelog of the **`common/` folder itself**, separate from the
example's own `CHANGELOG.md`. The folder is vendored (copied) into every
example repository in the BACnet profile example series; this file plus the
`COMMON_VERSION` constant in `CASExampleHelper.h` tell you whether a given
example's copy is stale.

**Rule:** any change to anything in `common/` bumps `COMMON_VERSION`, gets an
entry here, and must then be re-copied into **every** example in the series.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the folder adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-15

The **reconciliation release**: this is the first version that is genuinely
byte-identical in every example, and the first that is enforced rather than
asserted.

### Fixed

- **`PollKey()` no longer blocks the tick loop forever when stdin is not a tty.**
  `EnableRawInput()` called `tcgetattr` first and **returned early on failure**,
  before setting `O_NONBLOCK`. Under CI, `docker run -i` without `-t`, or a pipe
  with no data, the next `read(STDIN_FILENO, ...)` blocked indefinitely —
  `BACnetStack_Tick()` never ran again and **the device went deaf while still
  looking alive**. `O_NONBLOCK` is now set unconditionally, before the tty check;
  raw mode is still only applied to a real terminal. (`< /dev/null` masked this,
  which is why it survived the smoke tests.)
- **Windows now asks for `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` instead of `SO_REUSEADDR`.** On
  Windows `SO_REUSEADDR` lets *any* other local process bind the same port and
  silently steal traffic — the exact failure the series runbook's gotcha 2 warns
  about ("a stale instance can answer your requests and make a correct device look
  broken"), shipped enabled in the file customers copy. POSIX keeps
  `SO_REUSEADDR` (there it mainly means "rebind quickly after restart", which is
  what makes multi-device testing work). The comment now states the hazard, not
  just the convenience.

### Added

- **`HandleHelpAndVersionArgs()` — `--help` and `--version` now actually exist.**
  The series conventions require every example to parse `--help`, `--version`,
  `--deviceID` and `--port`, and every README documented all four, but the helper
  only ever parsed `--port` and `--deviceID`: `--help` was the first thing a
  newcomer typed and the app just booted. Also accepts `-h` and `/?`.
- `CASBACnetStackExampleConstants.h` is now the **true series-wide union**, not
  just B-SS's set: DeviceCommunicationControl (`DCC_*`,
  `SERVICE_DEVICE_COMMUNICATION_CONTROL`, `ERROR_CODE_PASSWORD_FAILURE`),
  alarm/event (`SERVICE_ACKNOWLEDGE_ALARM`, `*_EVENT_NOTIFICATION`,
  `SERVICE_GET_EVENT_INFORMATION`, `NOTIFY_TYPE_*`,
  `OBJECT_TYPE_NOTIFICATION_CLASS`, `OBJECT_TYPE_ANALOG_VALUE`),
  ReinitializeDevice, time-sync, RPM/WPM, the A-side `*_SERVICE_TYPE` aliases and
  `BACNET_DATATYPE_REAL`, and `ENGINEERING_UNITS_PERCENT`.

### Notes

- **The 1.1.0 entry below claimed this file was already the "series-wide
  superset". That was false**, and the claim did real damage: B-SS's copy never
  had the `DCC_*` constants that B-ASC had carried since its first commit, so the
  runbook's own instruction to seed a new example's `common/` from B-SS **would
  not compile** for any DCC-bearing profile. 1.2.0 is the first version for which
  the claim is actually true.
- Measured before this release: only **2 of 6** populated examples declared
  `COMMON_VERSION` at all (B-SS, B-SA); B-ASC, B-AAC, B-OD and B-LD had neither it
  nor this changelog — so the staleness mechanism did not lie, it **did not
  exist** in those repos, and their `PrintVersion` could not print the helper
  version line. Fixed by sweeping this folder to every example.
- Going forward this is checked, not trusted: the parent repo's CI diffs every
  `examples/*/common` against B-SS's and fails on any delta.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- `COMMON_VERSION` constant in `CASExampleHelper.h` and this changelog — the
  folder now carries its own version so each example can tell whether its
  vendored copy is stale. `PrintVersion` prints it alongside the app + stack
  versions.
- `CASBACnetStackExampleConstants.h` gained the output object types, the
  commandable-property identifiers (`Priority_Array`, `Relinquish_Default`), and
  the error codes introduced for B-SA. (This entry originally claimed the file was
  the "series-wide superset" — see the 1.2.0 notes; it was not.)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- `GetPrimaryIPv4` (Windows): check the subnet-mask `inet_pton` return and
  zero-initialize the `in_addr`, so a mask string that fails to parse can no
  longer be read uninitialized (it falls back to the limited broadcast).
  (Shipped in B-SS v1.0.2; the folder was unversioned at the time.)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Initial vendored helper: `CASExampleHelper` (UDP transport + time callbacks,
  version/help printing, `--port` / `--deviceID` parsing, keyboard commands
  h/q/up/down, local-IPv4 + broadcast lookup, unsolicited I-Am on start-up),
  `SimpleUDP` (cross-platform UDP socket wrapper), and
  `CASBACnetStackExampleConstants.h`.
